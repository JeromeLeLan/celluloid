# Celluloid

Celluloid gathers information about two movie collections. The ones I've watched and the ones belonging to the [Criterion Collection](https://www.criterion.com/).

Its purpose is to keep track of what I've watched and help me decide what to watch next, by producing statistics and analysing data.

Website is available [here](https://celluloid.dev).
